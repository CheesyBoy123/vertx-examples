= Vert.x Redis Client examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating the usage of the Vert.x Redis Client.

* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/examples/redis/RedisClientVerticle.java[RedisClientVerticle.java]

To run this example, you need a running Redis instance. Once running, you can configure the
verticles with the redis host:

----
{
    "host": "192.168.59.103"
}
----

By default, it uses `127.0.0.1` as host. The post is set to `6379`.
