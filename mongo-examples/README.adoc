= Vert.x Mongo Client examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating the usage of the Vert.x Mongo Client.

* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/examples/mongo/MongoClientVerticle.java[MongoClientVerticle.java]

To run this example, you need a running Mongo instance. Once running, you can configure the
verticles with the mongo host:

----
{
    "mongo_uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "mongo_db" : "test"
}
----

By default, it uses `localhost` as host.
The port is set to `27017`.
