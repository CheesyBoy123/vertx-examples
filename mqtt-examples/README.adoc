= Vert.x MQTT examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x MQTT server and client in action.

Vert.x MQTT provides a server which is able to handle connections, communication and messages exchange with
remote MQTT clients.

Vert.x MQTT provides also a client.

Please consult the Vert.x MQTT documentation for more information.

Examples can be run directly from the IDE by executing the `main` method.

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/mqtt/simple/Client.java[Java echo mqtt client]

=== App

In this example you can find a usage of significant part of both of Client and Server API

link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/mqtt/app/Client.java[Java mqtt client app]

=== SSL

This is the same as the Simple example but using SSL to encrypt connections
